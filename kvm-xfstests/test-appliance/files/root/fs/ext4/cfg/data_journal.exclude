# In data=journal mode, fsync() will try to write data blocks into
# the journal.  This will cause the file system to go read-only
# when the journal aborts as a result of the device being put
# into dm-error mode, and this guarantees that this test will fail.

# Ext4 doesn't suppport mounting with norecovery && data=journal.
# We could fix this in the future by no giving an error in the case
# where we are mounting with ro, norecovery, and data=journal.
# (XFS requires ro with norecovery, and perhaps we should make
# a similar restriction.)

# This test uses dioread_nolock which currently isn't supported with
