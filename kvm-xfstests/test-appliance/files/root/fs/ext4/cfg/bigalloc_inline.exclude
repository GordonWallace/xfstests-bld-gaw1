ext4/004	# dump/restore doesn't handle the bigalloc feature

# ext4/033 creates a special file system using dmhugedisk to test for
# inode overflow when online resizing.  With a bigalloc config, this takes
# too much space, so test VM will hang or abort the test run.  We
# don't need to test this for all file system configs, so just skip it here.

# This takes a *long* time and doesn't add much value to run on all
# configurations.  So we're going to be selective where we run it.
