# The test generic/471 tests the RWF_NOWAIT flag; however
# how it is supposed to work with file systems is disputed,
# and not all device drivers support it.  As a result
# it doesn't work if an LVM device driver is in use (as is the
# case with gce-xfstests).  So let's suppress it for now.  For
# more details see:

# The proposed fix for generic/484, "locks: change POSIX lock
# ownership on execve when files_struct is displaced" would break NFS
# Jeff Layton and Eric Biederman have some ideas for how to address it
# but fixing it is non-trivial

# This test has false positives on all file systems that don't support
# copy_file_range, since swap files can be read by root, and this
# test tries to enforce that copy_file_range won't work on swap files.
# Unfortunately, xfs_io falls back to read/write if necessary, which
# causes generic/554 to fail.
