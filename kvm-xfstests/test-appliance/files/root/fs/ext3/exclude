# ext4/023 tests the populate function which needs to require files with
# extents.  This doesn't work with ext3, naturally.
ext4/023

# The generic/382 test fails on ext3 because the indirect blocks
# are included in the quota report, and so the resulting quota
# report output is different from what is expected in the 382.out file
generic/382

# The generic/235 test fails for the same rason as generic/382 above
# after xfstests 4f4b89cdf353 which was fixing the test for 64k block
# sizes.  Unfortunately it breaks the test which use indirect blocks.
